1. Overview
------------------------------------------------------------
You will debug a tiny ATM simulator program that uses if / elif / else
logic for authentication, menu selection, and withdrawing money.
The starter code is intentionally broken (syntax, indentation, type,
and logic bugs). Your job: fix it so it runs correctly and handles
common edge cases.


2. What the Program Should Do
------------------------------------------------------------
• Ask the user for a numeric PIN.
• If the PIN matches the stored PIN (default 1234), show a menu:
    1. Check Balance
    2. Withdraw Money
• If user chooses 1 → print current balance.
• If user chooses 2 → ask for withdrawal amount:
    – If amount is <= balance and > 0, deduct and show new balance.
    – Otherwise, print “Insufficient funds” (or invalid amount).
• If PIN is wrong → deny access.
• Handle invalid menu choices gracefully.
